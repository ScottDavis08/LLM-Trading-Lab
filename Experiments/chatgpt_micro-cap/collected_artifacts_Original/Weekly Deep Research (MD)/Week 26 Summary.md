# Thesis Review Summary

As we enter the final week of this 6-month experiment, our portfolio strategy has evolved into a focused but  
risk-managed stance. Below is a summary of each current position’s thesis and the rationale behind our  
latest actions, as well as how the portfolio is positioned for Week 26:

## Milestone Pharmaceuticals (MIST) – Approved Drug Catalyst, Now a Growth Story

**Thesis:**  
MIST was our high-conviction bet on FDA approval of etripamil (Cardamyst) for PSVT, which came  
to fruition on Dec 12, 2025 with a positive approval decision. This validates our thesis that etripamil’s  
strong Phase 3 data and clear unmet need would lead to approval. Now the company transitions to  
commercialization.

**Key points:**  
- **First-in-class Product:** Cardamyst is the first self-administered therapy  
  for PSVT, addressing a significant patient need (avoiding ER visits for sudden tachycardia episodes). This  
  gives MIST a unique market position.  
- **Resolved Risks:** The earlier regulatory risk is gone. Manufacturing  
  issues from 2021’s CRL were overcome, and no safety concerns were raised in this review. The approval  
  news confirmed that narrative.  
- **Financial Strength:** Milestone’s balance sheet is robust – they have ~$82M  
  in cash and are set to receive a $75M milestone payment from RTW upon approval. This non-dilutive  
  financing means the upcoming drug launch is well-funded, reducing risk of near-term dilution.  
- **Upside Potential:** Many analysts had price targets in the $4–$7 range pre-approval. With a ~$2.15 stock  
  price (market cap ~$180M), there is substantial room for the market to re-rate MIST as a revenue-generating  
  company. If Cardamyst sees strong uptake or if Milestone secures a partnership for broader marketing, the  
  stock could climb further. Also, MIST could become a takeover candidate given its niche (larger  
  cardiovascular players might eye Cardamyst’s niche market).  
- **Recent Action & Plan:** The stock ran up into the high-$2s before approval and then settled in the low-$2s  
  after a “sell-the-news” bout of profit-taking. This is not unusual for small biotechs post-catalyst. We’re  
  holding our 14 shares because we believe the medium-term trajectory is upward as investors refocus on  
  sales potential. However, acknowledging that the catalyst is past and volatility might decrease, we’ve  
  tightened our stop to $1.80 to secure gains. We are comfortable holding through the week, expecting either  
  sideways or modestly bullish movement. Our thesis confidence remains very high – Milestone is  
  fundamentally stronger than ever after delivering on the catalyst. In the Week 26 context, MIST provides a  
  stable foundation with possible upside from any positive post-approval developments (e.g., analyst  
  upgrades or year-end biotech rally). We’ll monitor but likely just ride this position into the final tally, unless  
  an unforeseen event occurs.

## SELLAS Life Sciences (SLS) – Phase 3 Binary Event, Trimmed to “Ride Free”

**Thesis:**  
SLS is our moonshot play on the Phase 3 REGAL trial of galinpepimut-S (GPS), a cancer  
immunotherapy for AML in second remission. The essence of the thesis was high risk but astronomical  
reward:

- **Rationale for Upside:** GPS showed promising Phase 2 results (21-month median overall survival)  
  and targets a common antigen (WT1) present in most AML cases. If Phase 3 is successful, GPS would  
  become the first maintenance therapy in CR2 AML, addressing a critical gap. The total addressable  
  market (including AML CR2, post-transplant, and potentially CR1) is large, and success would validate  
  SELLAS’s entire platform. Bulls (ourselves included) argued that the trial’s unusually long duration (still not  
  hitting the final event when expected) is “generally inconsistent with a control-driven outcome,” hinting  
  the vaccine might be extending lives. This statistical nuance gave us hope that REGAL could succeed  
  against the odds.  
- **Current Developments:** SELLAS’s behavior has been encouraging: they have over $70M cash  
  (runway into 2027), which is rare for a micro-cap to be funded past a Phase 3 readout – it means even in  
  failure, the company isn’t immediately insolvent (some value remains via cash and their secondary asset  
  SLS009). They also kept a tiny headcount and engaged with potential pharma partners, indicating they  
  might prefer to be acquired if GPS works. Importantly, at $1.41 (our entry, ~$190M cap), the stock was  
  “priced as if REGAL has already failed,” according to one analysis. Even after the run to ~$2.30 (now  
  ~$335M cap), one could argue it still only partially prices in success (since a successful GPS could justify  
  well over $500M cap).  
- **Risk Management Move:** That said, we always knew this was a lottery ticket with maybe 15–20%  
  chance of success. With the stock up significantly, we made the decision to trim our position by ~62%  
  (8 of 13 shares) to secure our initial capital and some profit. This essentially reduces our cost-basis on  
  remaining shares to near $0. We can now hold the remaining 5 shares through the binary event with a  
  cool head, as it’s essentially house money. Our thesis is still that there is a chance for a huge win – and we  
  want to be there for it – but we’ve drastically limited the damage if it’s a loss.  
- **Catalyst Outlook:** We expect top-line results literally any day now (the company guided final analysis by  
  year-end). The outcomes are extreme:  
  - **If REGAL is Positive:** SLS could gap up 100%+ (we foresee a move to at least ~$4–$5 in the short  
    term, possibly higher if buyout speculation kicks in). Even with only 5 shares, that would be a  
    meaningful gain for us. The thesis in that scenario would shift to evaluating exit vs. hold: likely we’d  
    take most profits quickly, as such events often see volatility and we’d be near experiment end. But it  
    would validate the “moonshot” approach.  
  - **If REGAL is Negative:** SLS likely collapses toward cash value (~$0.70–$0.90). With just 5 shares,  
    our remaining exposure is very small (we’d lose maybe ~$8 at worst, which we can tolerate). We  
    have a stop at $1.10, but as noted, in a failure it might open well below that. We’re mentally prepared  
    for this outcome too – it’s the price of playing biotech lotto. Our prior trim means overall the SLS trade  
    would still net out close to breakeven or a slight gain even if the last bit goes to near $0.  
- **Thesis Confidence:** Moderate (but highly binary). We’re more optimistic than when we first bought  
  (the extended survival and stock’s strength improve our confidence), but we remain realistic: cancer  
  vaccines have historically struggled, and this is essentially a coin flip. By adjusting our position size,  
  we’ve aligned our risk with that reality while keeping the thesis alive. This week SLS is the make-or-break  
  catalyst for potentially catching up to the benchmark – it’s the wild card that could either narrow the  
  performance gap dramatically or simply fizzle out. Our actions reflect a disciplined way to engage with  
  this thesis: partake in the upside, but not bet the farm on it. We’ll know soon enough how the story ends.

## Jasper Therapeutics (JSPR) – New Addition: Turnaround Catalyst with Momentum

**Thesis:**  
JSPR is our newly initiated position, chosen to deploy idle cash into a catalyst-driven opportunity  
that isn’t a binary event but offers a strong rebound narrative:

- **Company & Catalyst:** Jasper is a biotech working on briquilimab, an antibody with multiple potential uses  
  (bone marrow transplant conditioning, chronic urticaria, and most recently being tested in asthma). The  
  stock was crushed in mid-2025 after an unexpected lack of efficacy in part of an early trial (the “BEACON”  
  study in chronic urticaria). However, on Dec 2, 2025 Jasper announced positive preliminary data from its  
  Phase 1b “ETESIAN” trial in allergic asthma, showing meaningful reductions in airway hyper-responsiveness  
  and eosinophil counts. At the same time, they completed an investigation into the prior trial’s anomaly,  
  presumably addressing the market’s concerns. This one-two punch of good news has the potential to reset  
  the market’s view on Jasper.  
- **Deep Value Aspect:** At around $1.86/share (when we decided to buy), JSPR’s market cap is only ~$50M.  
  Meanwhile, Jasper has ~$50.9M in cash on its balance sheet. This implies the enterprise value is nearly  
  zero – investors are basically assigning no value to Jasper’s pipeline. That is likely an overreaction to the  
  earlier hiccup. Now that some positive data is in hand, there’s a case to be made that the pipeline does  
  have value (asthma is a huge market, and even though this is early data, it’s a proof-of-concept that could  
  attract partners or at least improved sentiment). In short, JSPR looks like a classic beaten-down biotech  
  that’s begun to turn the corner, and its stock could have a sharp upward correction as confidence rebuilds.  
- **Momentum & Sentiment:** We also chose JSPR for technical reasons – since the Dec 2 news, the stock’s  
  trend has been upward (with daily moves like +8% on Dec 18 to $1.89). It appears traders are slowly  
  coming back to it. There might also be year-end dynamics at play: tax-loss sellers (the stock is down ~84%  
  YTD) may have finished selling by now, and bargain hunters are swooping in. We want to ride this  
  potential January Effect rally a bit early, in the final week of December.  
- **Catalyst Path Forward:** While we don’t anticipate a specific binary event this week (e.g., no FDA  
  decision or Phase 3 result imminent), there are mini-catalysts:  
  - Jasper’s management is likely to present more data at upcoming conferences (maybe AAAAI or ATS  
    for asthma in early 2026). Sometimes, companies release additional data or updates around the  
    JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in January. It’s possible we get a hint of that or speculative run-up.  
  - The company might also announce next steps – e.g., expanding the asthma trial or starting a Phase 2.  
    Any such PR could bump the stock.  
  - Additionally, Jasper’s multiple programs (they also have trials in chronic spontaneous urticaria ongoing)  
    mean news flow can come from different angles – we’re not reliant on one thing. This is a nice contrast  
    to the rest of our portfolio which had very binary events.  
- **Risk:** Jasper is still a clinical-stage biotech burning cash, so risks include potential dilutive financing in  
  the mid-term and the chance that further data might not pan out. In the one-week horizon, the main risk  
  is if the initial excitement fades and the stock slides back down (hence our stop-loss at $1.50 to limit that  
  downside). There’s also volatility risk – at <$2, small stocks can swing.  
- **Our Game Plan:** We bought ~20 shares at ~$1.90. Our thesis is moderately high confidence that it’s  
  undervalued and due for a bounce, but we will not marry the position. We’ve set a stop to control downside  
  (~-21%). On the upside, if we see a solid lift (into mid-$2s), we’ll likely secure some profits. Essentially,  
  JSPR is our attempt to inject a fresh short-term alpha source into the portfolio at the eleventh hour – one  
  that isn’t all-or-nothing. We believe the risk-adjusted return here is attractive; even if it just climbs to  
  $2.50, that’s a ~30% gain, which would noticeably boost our portfolio. And if it disappoints, our stop will  
  ensure it only modestly hurts us.

**Thesis Confidence:** High in valuation gap, Moderate in immediate timeline.

## Overall Portfolio Thesis (Week 26)

We have repositioned for a final push that still aligns with our experimental strategy of seeking alpha from  
special situations, but with a careful eye on risk.

- A de-risked winner (MIST) – providing stability and a foundation of realized success.  
- A re-sized speculative bet (SLS) – still alive for a big score, but no longer carrying lethal portfolio risk.  
- A new opportunistic trade (JSPR) – aiming to capitalize on a clear catalyst-driven valuation disconnect,  
  with disciplined risk control.

At a high level, our thesis for this week is:

> **“Balance offense and defense.”**

We are still swinging for upside (SLS’s trial and JSPR’s rebound could drive outperformance if things go  
well), but we’ve also played defense by cutting exposure to the highest risk position and by setting stops  
to guard against adverse moves.

In the prior weeks, we went “all or nothing” on biotech catalysts – a strategy that yielded mixed results  
(one big win with MIST, one big loss with VTGN, and one pending with SLS). Now, with time nearly up, our  
approach is slightly adjusted: we still embrace the potential of a biotech payoff (SLS), but we’ve hedged it  
by taking profits; we’ve also diversified our bets slightly (adding JSPR’s non-binary catalyst) to improve our  
risk adjusted return profile.

We are essentially giving ourselves more ways to win or at least not lose: SLS could win, JSPR could climb,  
MIST could appreciate – any of those would help us, and not all of them have to happen for us to improve  
our standing. At the same time, even if one or two go wrong, the portfolio won’t be devastated because of  
our position sizing and stops.

## Next Week Thesis Outlook

Since this is the final week, our “thesis review” is more about how each position’s story will culminate.

- We expect to know the fate of SLS (thesis resolved one way or another).  
- MIST’s thesis will shift fully to execution of launch, which is beyond our timeframe, so our focus is just  
  on a clean exit at a fair price.  
- JSPR’s thesis might not fully play out in a week if it’s more of a medium-term recovery story, but we aim  
  to capture the initial leg of it now.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, our portfolio is positioned boldly but prudently. We have upside potential that is multiples  
of our downside risk, which is the ideal scenario in an asymmetric strategy. We’ve actively applied lessons  
learned (e.g., trimming SLS, not doubling down recklessly, cutting losers like VTGN quickly) and we’ve stayed  
within all rules and constraints.

The thesis driving each position has been reaffirmed or adjusted based on the latest information, and we  
believe each holding serves a purpose in the overall plan:

- **MIST:** Trust in a fundamental win – let it anchor and possibly grind higher.  
- **SLS:** Give ourselves a shot at a transformative win, but ensure survival if it fails.  
- **JSPR:** Seize a clear mispricing catalyst to add incremental alpha with controlled risk.

We enter the week cautiously optimistic. If things break our way, we have a credible chance to significantly  
narrow the gap with the S&P (or even, in a dream scenario, outperform it). If not, our downside is cushioned  
enough that we should still end up with a respectable outcome given the high-risk strategy we chose.

This balanced approach is our best foot forward for the final week, staying true to the portfolio’s high-alpha  
intent while respecting risk to the very end.
