## Weekly Deep Research

Each research week has:

- One Markdown summary (MD)
- One compiled PDF report

Naming convention:

- `Week <N> Summary.md`
- `Week <N>.pdf`

Example:

- `Week 12 Summary.md`
- `Week 12.pdf`

The index file (`deep_research_index.md`) is the canonical entry point.
Direct navigation of this directory is not required.
